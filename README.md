## About Me:
Years ago, when I worked as a professional photographer, I thought I was good. That was because my customers were happy with what I produced, they referred other people to me and returned to do business repeatedly. Nowadays I’m not so sure. That’s because my customer base is much, much smaller, almost entirely limited to myself, my friends and family. The last two groups have no complaints about my work, but that first guy, he’s a real stickler. It’s like he knows exactly what I wanted to do and where I failed, every time. He often knows just where I mess up but, strangely, it’s when he doesn’t that things get really frustrating.
